**	These routines provide a rudimentary capability for printing to
**	the screen and reading from the keyboard.  
**
** Screen output:
**	There are two families of functions.  The first provides a window
**	that behaves in the usual manner: writes extending beyond the right
**	edge of the window wrap around to the next line, the top line
**	scrolls off the window to make room for new lines at the bottom.
**	However, you may choose what part of the screen contains this
**	scrolling window.  This allows you to print some text at fixed
**	locations on the screen while the rest of the screen scrolls.
**
**	The second family allows for printing at fixed locations on the
**	screen.  No scrolling or line wrapping are done for these functions.
**	It is not intended that these functions be used to write in the
**	scrolling area of the screen.
**
**	In both sets of functions, the (x,y) coordinates are interpreted
**	as (column,row), with the upper left corner of the screen being
**	(0,0) and the lower right corner being (79,24).
**
**	The printf provided in both sets of functions has the same
**	conversion capabilities.  Format codes are of the form:
**
**		%-0WC
**
**	where "-", "0", and "W" are all optional:
**	  "-" is the left-adjust flag (default is right-adjust)
**	  "0" is the zero-fill flag (default is space-fill)
**	  "W" is a number specifying the minimum field width (default: 1 )
**	and "C" is the conversion type, which must be one of these:
**	  "c" print a single character
**	  "s" print a null-terminated string
**	  "d" print an integer as a decimal value
**	  "x" print an integer as a hexadecimal value
**	  "o" print an integer as a octal value
**
** Keyboard input:
**	Two functions are provided: getting a single character and getting
**	a newline-terminated line.  A third function returns a count of
**	the number of characters available for immediate reading. 
**	No conversions are provided (yet).
